the source code for the open-source game:
![potato game starring potatey](logo.png)

# how to edit the game!
[get gamemaker here](https://gamemaker.io), then run the yyp file and edit around do what ya want (needs gamemaker knowledge tho)

before you start editing the games contents and stuff, you should: 
- delete the keep file in ```/datafiles```
- credit [terrenebrick699](https://github.com/terrenebrick699)
- and most importantly, dont recompile this game without making any changes to the original code and claim the game as yours like a total dick (if that wasnt obvious)

(anyways i hope i didnt forget anything while i was dragging the files)
